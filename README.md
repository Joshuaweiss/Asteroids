Asteroids is my take on the classic arcade space shooter game.

# Overview
Asteroids is a space shooter created from the ground up using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. Two particularly interesting features to develop where elastic collisions and partial object wrapping. Elastic collisions allow objects to ricochet differently depending on there mass, velocity, and point of impact. Parial object wrapping allows objects to be seen leaving one side of the screen while simultaneously emerging from the other. Implementing this feature became more complex when dealing with elastic collisions because objects must rebound regardless of what side a partially wrapped object is impacted.
