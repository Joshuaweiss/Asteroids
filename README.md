Asteroids is my take on the classic arcade space shooter game.

# Overview
Asteroids is created from the ground up using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. A major focus was on the physics system which supports elastic collisions as well as the partial object wrapping. Larger asteroids can clearly be seen leaving one side of the screen while simultaneously emerging from the other. Implementing this feature became more complex when dealing with Elastic Collisions. Objects rebounds are dependent on the mass of the asteroids involved as well as there speed and point of impact. This works regardless of what side a partially wrapped object is impacted.
